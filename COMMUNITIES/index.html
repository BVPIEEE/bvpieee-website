            IEEE’s robotics and automation society was founded in 2014 by Shivam Bharadwaj. The main aim of RAS is to focus on awareness and development of technical skills in the field of Robotics and automation via theoretical knowledge and practical applications. Over the years, it has organized several competitions like Robo Soccor, Robotic Guardians of the Galaxy, Robotic Mazes, Arcades, Robo Rugby, etc. which were shown to have great acceptance as well as ample participation. RAS has also managed to pique the interest of many of the students to further pursue the field of robotics in higher studies as well as innovate ideas and study in depth at the top universities in the world such as New York University. The society has also carved students who were winning faces in several national and international competitions like eYantra and Celestini.

                The IEEE Student Branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Engineering got the approval for starting the women in engineering student branch affinity group on 21st June 2007.
                BVPIEE women in the engineering branch as the name suggests aims towards piquing the interests of girls in the field of engineering and science and to increase networking among young women who are studying engineering. Also, to establish contacts with prominent women in academia and industry who are interested in guiding girls in engineering. Thus encouraging women from all over the world to become professional engineers and scientists.
                The goal is to facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally. We envision a vibrant community of IEEE women and men collectively using their diverse talents to innovate for the benefit of humanity.
                BVPIEEE strives to:
