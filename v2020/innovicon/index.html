							<p>
								With technology moving at breakneck speed, we are now in the midst of a surge of new breakthroughs, where we carry more power in our pockets today. One such promising effort is ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. Artificial Intelligence  is a way of making a computer think rationally as humans do. This type of “deep learning” allows machines to process information for themselves on a very sophisticated level, allowing them to perform complex functions. It involves programming the computers for certain traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning, planning, ability to manipulate and move objects. From self driven cars to facial recognition technology, the key advances in AI have emboldened the public, policymakers and investors into believing that human-level machine intelligence is just around the corner.
							</p>
                            <p>
                            Exploiting the potential of this technology further, InnoviCon 2019 is a platform to delve deep into the emerging AI techniques and technologies.It brings together technology leaders and professionals to explore how AI systems are transforming operations, rewriting business strategy and creating new engines for rapid and disruptive growth. From presentations to discussions to latest technology insights, you will experience the latest in AI at this uniquely conceptualised conference.
