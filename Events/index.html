                    Tech-a-thlon 2.0 consisted of 3 rounds.
                    Info-a-thon: A general quiz on the G20 summit was conducted on
                    Quizizz. It was a time-based quiz. Judging was done based on the
                    number of correct and timely answers. At the end of round 1,
                    parcipants with lower scores were eliminated. Debug-a-palooza: It was a debugging competition held on google forms, where the
                    parcipants were tested on their knowledge of coding and its
                    intricacies. Each parcipant was given a problem that either had an
                    error or that did not produce the intended effect, they had to read
                    and rewrite only a few lines of code to fix these problems.
                    Code-a-thon: In this round parcipants were given various problems
                    sorted according to their difficulty, they had to solve these problems
                    with the best of their abilies keeping in mind the time and space
                    complexity.

                    The workshop took place on 28.12.2018-4.01.2019 in the library. The focus of the workshop was to recreate the natural
                    phenomena- aurora a.k.a. Northern lights using drones and light painting techniques and finally draw shapes, patterns
                    and images in the sky. Siddhart Talia (Makers Head) along with Kshitij Sidana (RnD Head, RAS) initiated the workshop by
                    explaining students about drones, the various components that go into its making and related concepts such as control
                    algorithms and path planning. Kshitij then apprised the students about photography concepts like ISO, shutter speed,
                    exposure and f-stop. The later days of the workshop witnessed the presence of E-cell Head, who inspired the students to
                    use this knowledge and come up with solutions to everyday problems with the goal of building a start-up. Towards the end
                    of the series, students implemented the concepts learnt and drew some images in the sky using the technique of light
                    painting, accomplished by the use of drones having autonomous capabilities.
                    <br/>
                    With a footfall of 64 attendees from different colleges, all geared up to apply the concepts learnt about 3D printing,
                    architecture, project planning, drone delivery, transportation and various other fields, the workshop was a big success.

                    The second edition of STAR (Student-Teacher And Research) program was organized by the Women In Engineering Affinity
                    Group of BVPIEEE on 5th
                    November 2018 in Rajkiye Pratibha Bal Vikas Vidyalaya. More than 50 students from classes 9th, 10th and 11th attended
                    the session and were taught the fundamentals of programming along with its applications by Abhinav Sobti and Priyal
                    Sobti; members from team BVPIEEE. Adopting a fun approach, the students were taught the concepts of coding through
                    analogies. Also, basic concepts of Robotics were introduced and a differential drive robot and face detection wireless
                    robot were displayed with the aim of creating awareness about Engineering and its applications in all walks of life.

                    The 10th edition of the fest was organised on March 7-8, 2018 with a lot of enthusiasm and saw a footfall of over 3000
                    students. The two-day extravaganza was preceded by the ‘Online Fervour’, a series of online events conducted on the
                    official facebook page of Fervour.
                    
                    The flagship events, Hacktivate- a 24-hour development hackathon, and Technovation- a technical projects exhibition and
                    competition, were a great success. While Robostacle and the Line Follower Challenge fueled the craze of robotics, Death
                    Star saw programmers interlocked in a competitive coding battle. B-plan tested the participants’ ability to present a
                    viable business plan, and Joey Doesn't Share Food gave all the foodies a chance to prove themselves.
                    
                    The highlight of the fest was a drone show organised by SDIoT. The flying FPV quadcopter
                    captured the audience's imagination. Prizes worth 10 lakh were given away in various online and offline events and
                    BVPIEEE successfully continued its legacy of hosting one of the finest techno-managerial fests in the city.
